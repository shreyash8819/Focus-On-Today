# 🎯 Focus on Today – A Minimal Daily Goal Tracker  

**Focus on Today** is a clean and interactive web application that helps users stay productive by setting and completing three daily goals. Designed with simplicity and clarity in mind, the app provides instant feedback, motivational quotes, and visual progress tracking to encourage users to stay focused, one day at a time.

## 🚀 Features  
- ✅ Add up to **three custom goals** for the day  
- 📈 Track progress with a dynamic **progress bar**  
- 🔁 **LocalStorage integration** ensures your data persists across sessions  
- 💡 Motivational quotes that change based on your progress  
- 📱 **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop screens  
- 🎨 Smooth UI with animations and a friendly visual style  

## 🛠️ Built With  
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)  
- Google Fonts  

## 📦 Folder Structure  
```
├── index.html       // Main HTML file  
├── style.css        // Custom styling  
├── script.js        // JavaScript logic for interactivity  
├── assets/          // (Optional) SVGs and images used in the UI  
```

## 🔍 How It Works  
1. Enter your 3 goals in the input fields.  
2. Click the circle to mark each goal as completed.  
3. Watch the progress bar update in real time.  
4. Refresh or revisit the page and your goals will still be there!  

## 💡 Motivation  
This project was created as a personal initiative to explore front-end fundamentals and build something useful from scratch. It helped solidify my knowledge of DOM manipulation, event handling, and data persistence in the browser.
